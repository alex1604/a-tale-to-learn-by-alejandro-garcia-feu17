What they did not know was that this cold world also consisted of a very dark, evil, dreadful and brutal creature called Tentor. Tentor is a kind of bird attacking from above, catch you in their wings made of paper and then asks you to write down answers of tricky questions. If you pass the test with at least 60% right answers the Tentor will let you free and you could keep going down the programming road. The Tentor has a powerful weapon against the Programmer. The Red Pen. The Tentor can use this pen to write down Icke Godk√§nd on your forehead and therefore destroy your future.
